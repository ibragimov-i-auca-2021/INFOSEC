What to Say:
Although oral traditions were rarely documented at the time, in 1898, a fragment from the "Semetey" chapter, as told by Tynybek, was recorded. Later, in 1925, this text was published in Moscow. It remains one of the few preserved examples of his performance, showcasing his unique style and talent.
